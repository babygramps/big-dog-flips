# CLAUDE.md

This repository is Muzak Season 2: a Vite + React SPA backed by a fresh Supabase database.

## Commands

- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — produce `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — serve the built `dist/`
- `npm run db:status` — list applied and pending migrations
- `npm run db:plan` — dry run; reports pending migrations, changes nothing
- `npm run db:deploy` — apply pending migrations

There is no test runner, linter, or type-checker configured. Verify changes with `npm run build` and the dev server.

The `db:*` scripts run `scripts/migrate.mjs`, which applies migrations through the Supabase Management API. It needs a personal access token in `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `~/.muzak-supabase-token`, and reads the project ref out of the Supabase URL in `.env.local`. `db:link` and `db:push` still drive the Supabase CLI instead; both paths record versions in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, so they stay interchangeable.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on the existing Netlify site, which builds from this repo. Pushing to `main` deploys; there is no manual upload step. Supabase credentials come from Vite environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Do not hardcode Supabase credentials in source. `public/_redirects` provides SPA fallback routing.

## No Auth

There is intentionally no login. Player identity is a player row stored in localStorage. Admin controls are openly accessible to everyone. Supabase RLS policies allow public read/write access.

## Season 2 Round Model

Do not use Season 1 round statuses or manual phase advancement.

Phases are computed from:

- `league_settings.schedule_start_date`
- `league_settings.weekly_phase_template`
- round `queue_position`
- current date in `America/Los_Angeles`

Default schedule:

- Monday-Wednesday: submission
- Thursday-Saturday: voting
- Sunday: appreciation

Phase boundaries happen at midnight Pacific. The app computes the correct phase when opened, so no client-side ticking transition or server cron is required.

Keep the queue stocked ahead of the current week. `addRound` appends at the end of the queue and derives `week_start_date` from that position, so a round added after the queue has already run dry is dated to a week that has passed and lands straight in history instead of becoming the current round.

## Round Sides

A round with at least `MIN_PLAYERS_TO_SPLIT` active players is split into two sides, so nobody has to listen to the whole league in one week.

- Sides live in `round_groups` and are assigned once, when the round becomes current. Whoever opens the app first writes them through the `assign_round_groups` RPC, which is first-writer-wins, so simultaneous clients cannot produce two different splits.
- `src/lib/groups.js` picks the split by minimising how often the same pair lands together, which keeps season-long pairings even. Do not replace it with a plain shuffle.
- Voting is scoped to your own side. A tab on the voting screen exposes the other side's songs for listening and commenting, with no vote controls and no scores. Song comments follow their song; the general round thread stays on your own side, following its author. The sidebar identifies players who did not submit; vote progress remains visible only for the voter's own side.
- Appreciation keeps one overall ranking, with the winner determined across both sides, but exposes each side's songs through the same Side A / Side B tabs. Its sidebar shows the final submission and voting status for every assigned player.
- Duplicate merges may not span sides, enforced in both `create_duplicate_merge` and the admin tool.
- Late joiners go to the smaller side via `join_round_group`. Sides are never rebalanced mid-round.
- Below the threshold, or before the migration is applied, the round runs as a single pool exactly as it did before.

## Voting

- Each player spends `league_settings.points_per_player` points per round, default 10. There is no per-song cap; the whole bank can go on one song.
- Players cannot score their own song. The UI omits the controls, and `src/lib/scoring.js` also discards self-votes at scoring time, so a stray row can never inflate a total.
- Songs are anonymous during voting. So are comments, behind a per-round alias from `src/lib/anonymousNames.js`. Appreciation reveals both.
- Each player sees the songs in their own order (`src/lib/listeningOrder.js`) so submission order does not bias results. Both the alias and the order are derived by hashing round plus player, so they are stable without being stored.
- Vote writes are debounced in `src/hooks/useDebouncedVotes.js`. Votes always stay attached to the original song row, including through duplicate merges.

## Surfaces

Four routes, all under `src/pages/`:

- `/` — Home: the current round, its phase, a countdown, and the submission, voting, or appreciation view from `src/pages/home/`.
- `/rounds` — queue, current round, and the past-round archive. Defined in `src/pages/QueuePage.jsx`, which exports `RoundsPage`; the filename predates the rename. Each archive card links to `/rounds/:roundId`, whose full scorecard reuses the appreciation results UI, including side rosters and final submission/voting status.
- `/players` — player directory, profile editing, and season standings. **Standings live here.** Round-by-round results live in the past-round archive rather than a standings table. There is no leaderboard page; `/leaderboard` redirects to this route.
- `/admin` — league settings, schedule editor, duplicate merge tool, and player activation. `AdminUnlock` is a slide-to-confirm gesture guarding against accidental taps, not a password.

The remaining Season 1 paths (`/queue`, `/archive`, `/history`, `/settings`) redirect into those four.

## Core Helpers

- `src/lib/schedule.js` owns Pacific-time scheduling, current round derivation, phase labels, and scored-round detection.
- `src/lib/scoring.js` owns duplicate-aware song totals and standings.
- `src/lib/groups.js` owns side assignment, balancing, and side lookup.
- `src/lib/supabase.js` owns the Supabase client and env-var guard.
- `src/lib/data.js` owns the per-page fetchers and the realtime table lists they subscribe to.
- `src/lib/mutations.js` owns every write except avatar uploads, which go through `src/lib/profilePictures.js`. No component or hook calls Supabase directly; keep it that way.

Keep scoring rules centralized in `src/lib/scoring.js`; duplicate handling must be identical on Home, Rounds history, and Players standings.

Standings count every past round plus the current round once it reaches appreciation. `getScoredRoundIds` in `src/lib/schedule.js` is the only place that decides which rounds those are.

## Duplicate Rules

Duplicate merges happen after voting. The app never mutates votes to merge duplicates. A merge group joins two or more song rows and chooses one canonical display song.

Scoring:

- Sum votes across all songs in the group.
- Remove votes from any submitter in that group.
- Add courtesy points equal to `submitter_count - 1`.
- Award the final merged total to every duplicate submitter.

Merges only apply within a side. Players on opposite sides never shared a voting pool, so there is no split vote for courtesy points to repair.

## Schema

The schema source of truth is `supabase/migrations/`; `SETUP.md` documents how to apply it. Keep migrations in sync with table assumptions in code.

## Profile Pictures

Profile pictures use the public Supabase Storage bucket `profile-pictures`. Uploads are resized in the browser before being stored at `players/<player-id>/avatar.webp`, and the resulting public URL is saved to `players.avatar_url`.
